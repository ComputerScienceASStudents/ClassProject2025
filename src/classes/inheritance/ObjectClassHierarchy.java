package classes.inheritance;

/**
 * at the top of every heirarchy every object essentially "inherits" object class
 * with this we can say that the object class is a superclass of every other classes
 * the object class is a part of the java.lang package
 * 
 * We also saw in the example the use of packages – Java packages are a
    mechanism to group Java classes that are related to each other, into the
    same "module" (package)
 * 
 * 
 * When a Java project grows bigger, for instance an app or API, it is useful to
split the code into multiple Java classes, and the classes into multiple Java
packages
* 
* Classes can have the same identifier name as long as they are in different
packages (other programming languages use a similar system called
“namespaces”)
* 
* think of the java package like a file system directory
* 
* java packages can contain sub packages (ex. classes.inheritance)
* and Java packages can thus
make up what is called a package structure
* 
* (a Java package structure is like
a directory structure on your hard drive, or as directories inside a JAR files)
